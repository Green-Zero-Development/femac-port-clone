As an employer, you have an obligation to do your part in keeping your employees safe while they’re on the job. You can do that by being proactive and taking steps towards safety before dangerous situations even arise. You can also make sure that everyone on the job is prepared in case a situation does come up. Having security guidelines in place is beneficial for everyone. Here are three ways you can make sure that everyone who works for you is safe:

## #1 Schedule Monthly Safety Drills

The extent of your safety drills will depend on the type of business you run. For example, construction jobs will require different safety skills than a retail job. However, there are some basic tips that everyone can benefit from, regardless of their industry. You should hold regular drills with your employees on what to do in case of a fire or tornado. These are events that can strike at any time. They are also high-pressure scenarios, so it’s very important that your employees be familiar with the safety guidelines so that everyone is safe if the actual event takes place.

## #2 Plan for Worst-Case Scenarios

This involves having regular safety drills, but it goes beyond that. You and your employees should have a plan for what everyone will do in a worst-case situation. For example, what if an armed robber holds up your store? What if someone experiences a medical emergency on the job? It may not be feasible to have a drill for some scenarios, but you can talk it over with your employees and make sure that they know what to do. An action plan gives all of you something to immediately start working towards, so that you can resolve the situation quickly and without any unnecessary danger.

## #3 Minimize the Risk of Injury to Employees

Train all of your employees regarding proper job safety. There are certain tools that they may need in order to do their jobs safely (no-slip shoes, for example), and you should enforce a rule that requires them to have those things. These rules may seem excessive, but they prevent employees from becoming lax and, potentially, putting themselves into a dangerous situation on the job. You as a business owner can also do a big part in keeping everyone safe. Be sure to keep up with building codes, regular maintenance on any machinery, and local ordinances regarding job safety.

To be 100% on top of things, consider training your staff to complete simple first-aid. No one workspace is always safe and sound, and any employee familiar and practiced in first-aid is both an asset and a valuable lifesaver.
