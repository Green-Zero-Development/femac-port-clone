Whether it’s your home or office, chances are you keep a lot of valuable items and information close at hand. ID documents, bank statements, and fine jewelry are just a few of the things that need to be protected from falling into the wrong hands. You can prevent theft by taking a few simple steps to protect the things that matter most to you.

## #1 Utilize a Proper Safe

A good safe should be fire-retardant, break-in resistant, and bolted to the floor. Many home and business owners will use a small portable safe so that they can take their valuables on the go, but this is really not safe at all. Burglars can easily take these safes with them and break into them later, after the robbery is over and the danger of getting caught has passed. Don’t let this happen to you. Invest in a safe that isn’t going anywhere, no matter what robbers try.

## #2 Don’t Make Hiding Places Obvious

There are certain spots where everyone tends to hide valuables. The sock drawer, the top of the refrigerator, under a pillow, a fake rock…you get the idea. Thieves, especially those who have been in the business for a while, know what sorts of places people generally hide things. It’s best not to hide your valuables at all, but rather to place them in a strong safe like the one mentioned above. However, if you absolutely must stash something for safekeeping, put it in a counterintuitive place that no one would ever think to check. And don’t share your hiding places with anyone, especially if you’re a business owner. Unfortunately, you never know who you can trust to keep it secret.

## #3 Invest in a Security System

Even the best plans go awry, and despite your best efforts, you may be the victim of a robbery at some point. However, the best way to make sure that you don’t lose your most valuable possessions is to invest in a top-of-the-line security system. Simply having a system acts as a deterrent to thieves, who are usually seeking the path of least resistance and will often leave you be if they see that a system is in place. And in the event of a break-in, the system will notify the police so that the thieves can be caught. In addition to being professionally monitored you can access a good alarm or video system through an App on any Smart Device to check on the status of it and receive instant notifications while you’re away. It’s peace of mind that no home or business should be without.
