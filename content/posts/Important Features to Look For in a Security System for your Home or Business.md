A security system, whether it be commercial or for personal use, is an incredibly important investment opportunity. And investing in a security system that doesn’t meet your needs wastes both your investment and your time. By focusing on these four essential features, you can rest easy knowing your home or business is protected, and that your investment is valuable and beneficial to the safe operation of either or.

**Ease of Operation** – You, your family, or your employees should not be forced to interact with an obscure interface when using your security system. Ease of use is an important concern to account for – without it, training can cost you time and money. Additionally, the easier something is to use, the more likely you are to be able to set it up and use it on a daily basis correctly. If something is too complicated to use all of the features, what’s the point?

Look for these sorts of things:

- Large, standard icons which are easily identifiable.

- Simple UI with a screen that is large enough to interact comfortably with.

- A password protection function which isn’t a hindrance, but not protect adequately.

**Remote Control Capability** – Your smartphone can now help control your security system from afar. There are apps available for both iPhone and Android that tie into your system and allow you to turn it on and off, receive alerts, and more – even when you’re away from the premises. This cuts down on the amount of times you realize you forgot to set the alarm or respond to false alarm events at home. You can turn your alarm on or off from your phone and save all kinds of time on unnecessary tasks. Without mobile access to your security system, you’ll be shooting yourself in the foot by giving up valuable control of your system.

Mobile access can help:

- Monitor your home or business while away

- Arm or disarm your system remotely

**Automation Integration** – Automation can both help save money and time if properly integrated with your systems. With newer systems, you can set your alarm, adjust the temperature of your space, turn on the lights, and more from one place. And don’t forget, with remote control apps, you can actually do all of this before you even walk in the door each morning.

**Fire Protection** – Updated devices have a fire alarm that comes along with your security system. Traditional fire alarms with batteries or tied into the power in your building can die, don’t call anyone on their own, and may not even wake you up during an emergency. However, a device tied into a security system is “smart” and will tell you if something is wrong and can even call the 911 center.
