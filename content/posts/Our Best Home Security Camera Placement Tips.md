With a property crime happening about every 3.5 seconds, home security and video surveillance top the list of homeowner needs. At a cursory glance, video surveillance seems pretty straight-forward; you just place a camera where you want to see what is happening and done. Unfortunately, it isn’t that easy. Video surveillance camera placement also involves a lot of technical knowledge to avoid all of the common problems that plague improperly installed surveillance systems, such as fuzzy images, glare, and reduced coverage area.

**To avoid those problems, we put together our most helpful camera placement tips.**

1. When placing a camera, think about the light that will hit it throughout the entire day. Many poorly placed cameras become ineffective for large portions of the day because of glare from the sun, off windows or other shiny objects.

2. Do not place cameras too high or too low. The right position will matter in what you capture in identifiable information.

3. Fit the type of camera to the need. Video surveillance cameras are not one-size-fits-all. While an ill-fit camera can provide some help in deterrence, it may not provide much help in actual images if it is not specifically fit to the application.

4. Choose cameras with a wide dynamic range for outdoor purposes.

5. Understand the differences between security camera markets. While they look the same on the outside,the components used to make cameras for different markets are of very different qualities, so the difference between a box store camera and cameras used by security industry professionals is actually vast.

6. Learn about camera features such as day/night, varifocal, infrared, resolution, zoom, autofocus, wireless, and thermal imaging. What you know helps in choice, placement, and use.  

7. Consider every side of the house from a criminal’s point of view. Place cameras at obscure points of vulnerability.

8. Make sure to choose cameras with night-vision capabilities or provide enough lighting for it to work 24/7.

9. Make sure your cameras capture images that would only be otherwise viewable to the public.

10. Consult a professional. By talking with a home security professional, you save a lot of time and money and ensure your video surveillance system works as it should.

We all love a great do-it-yourself project, but when it comes to protecting your family, home, and property it is always a good idea to consult professionals. Cameras come in many levels of quality, have a multitude of different options, functions, and capabilities; and proper placement and installation take a considerable understanding of the equipment and other dynamics.
