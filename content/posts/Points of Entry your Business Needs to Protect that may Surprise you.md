Businesses owners are very aware of security threats to their inventory and physical building. Of course you don’t just let people walk through your front door at night! Chances are good that you lock up when you leave and probably even set an alarm system in case someone breaks through your lock. But is that it? Criminals who want to steal and vandalize don’t just use the easiest point of entry to accomplish their crime.

In fact, the very places you think of first are probably where they would try last. They don’t want to be caught, so they’re much more likely to attempt a break in through one of these places instead:

## #1 Loading Docks

If your business is a warehouse or retail store with a loading dock to have product delivered, this can be a location targeted by criminals. Not only is it probably located in the rear or side of the building, it may not be getting actually locked at night. Loading docks can be made secure with:

- Alarm Systems
- Video Surveillance

## #2 Backdoors

Backdoors are often used as a point of entry for a thief because the last employees of the shift forget to lock it. Since they aren’t exiting through it to leave for the day, it’s easy to see why it can sometimes go forgotten. Setting up several security systems at the backdoor will eliminate this problem:

- Alarm Systems
- Video Surveillance
- Access Control Panels with a Card Reader

## #3 Windows

If a criminal wants to get in badly enough and the doors are locked, they’re going to try a window next. It’s easy to break through the glass, get what they’re looking for, and get out quickly. Instead of letting them get away, install security systems that will either prevent them or ensure they’re caught in the act:

- Alarm Systems
- Video Surveillance
- Pneumatic Delivery Systems
