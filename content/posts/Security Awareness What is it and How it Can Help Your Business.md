## What is it:

By definition, security awareness is the knowledge and attitude members of an organization possess regarding the protection of the physical, and especially informational, assets of that organization. Many organizations, including businesses like yours, require formal security awareness training for all staff members when they are hired, as well as periodically thereafter. This often occurs annually.

Topics covered in security awareness training often include:

- The nature of sensitive material and physical assets they may come in contact with, such as company secrets. This can be anything from a special recipe to the company’s quarterly profits.

- The correct way to protect sensitive information on computer systems, including password policy and use of two-factor authentication. Other computer security concerns, including malware, phishing, and social engineering are also included.

- Requirements for proper handling of sensitive documents in physical paper form, which often includes marking, transmission, storage and destruction.

- Employee and contractor responsibilities in handling sensitive information, including review of employee nondisclosure agreements.

- Physical workplace security. This encompasses anything from building access, wearing of security badges, reporting of incidents, forbidden activities, and beyond.

- The consequences of failure to adhere to any of the security rules, including potential loss of employment, financial consequences, damage to individuals whose private records are divulged, and possible civil and criminal penalties.

## How it helps businesses like yours:

Being “security aware” means you understand that there is the potential for some people in your company to steal or mishandle sensitive information, either deliberately or accidentally. Of course,by realizing this it is clear that it would be a good idea to attempt to stop that from happening. The best way to do that is to start the training as soon as possible.
