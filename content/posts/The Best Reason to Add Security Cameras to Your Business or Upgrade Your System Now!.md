If the quality of the video is poor in your Video Surveillance system or it’s more than 4 or 5 years old there are several reasons why you should consider upgrading now. 

Advancements in technology have made it possible to buy much better quality cameras at a much lower price. Better software has made it possible to remotely manage your system with the same functions you’d use if you were sitting in front of the system. Alerts, Video Analytics, Digital Storage, Infrared Night Vision cameras,Hybride HD/IP and analog systems save you money by letting you use the wire you already have. If you don’t currently have a system there has never been a better time to purchase one. 

**The Best Reason:** New Tax Incentives for Security and Fire Protection Systems.

What should be exciting for small and medium sized businesses are the changes to section 179.
It used to allow businesses to deduct up to $500,000 in qualified expenses in a given year, but now it  allows up to $1,000,000 and before it didn’t include Security Systems (Including Video Security Cameras), Fire Systems, Fire Alarms or Burglar Alarms and now it does. 

Under the new tax law enacted in late December, 2017, businesses may deduct the full cost of security and fire protection systems for the year in which they are installed and placed into service. This rule applies for a few years and will subsequently start to decrease. The IRS rules can be found on their website at:
