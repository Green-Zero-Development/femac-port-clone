As a business owner, you probably hear a lot about cyber security. Your computers, network, servers, and mobile devices used everyday are liable to be hacked into, potentially costing you thousands. However, don’t get so wrapped up in cyber security that you forget about the actual physical building. It takes a sophisticated thief to get into your passwords and bank accounts, but anyone with a large rock can break in through a window. Here’s what you need to install to keep safe:

## #1 Outside Lighting

One of the most important things you can do to keep your office, retail store, or warehouse safe is to make sure that you have strong exterior lighting. Thieves don’t want to be seen, so putting up floodlights or other large light sources will make your building less likely to become a target in the middle of the night. If you’re concerned about the energy bill or the bright lights disturbing other around you, consider getting motion-activated lights that only come on when something moves past a sensor.

## #2 Security Cameras

Cameras are affordable and easy to install at multiple points across the property. A potential thief will probably run if they see a camera pointing at them. A security camera will also record exactly what happens, so if you should ever need evidence to use in court or to provide to the police, the security footage will take care of that.

## #3 Access Control

Breaking in is sometimes not done by a stranger. It’s an unfortunate fact that many commercial business crimes are done by the employees themselves, so anyone with a key can move about your office undetected. With a top-of-the-line access , it won’t be so easy for them! An access control panel is usually operated by means of door hardware controlled by a card reader, key card, or keyfob. It is literally a means of controlling “who goes where and when” and providing an audit trail for it.

## #4 Alarm System

You know the benefits of an alarm system: if someone attempts to break in, the police will be notified immediately and they won’t get away. However, many business owners are using outdated security systems because they don’t realize that better options are available. If you’re still bound to the system you purchased decades ago, it’s time to upgrade. Not only are there new accessories for your system that allow you to monitor your property better than ever before (like security cameras that live-stream footage), but even the basic technology has been improved as well.

## #5 Strong Windows and Doors

One of the best ways to keep someone from breaking in is to make it difficult for them. Time is of the essence when criminals are attempting to steal. If it takes them more than a few seconds to get inside, they won’t risk it- especially if your alarm is going off. Make sure your windows and doors are too strong to taken out easily.
