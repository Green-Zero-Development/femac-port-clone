Vacations are our time to relax and unwind– so the last thing you want is to come home and find that your business has been broken into or vandalized while you were away. Fortunately, there are resources available to help you make sure that doesn’t happen. Common sense, along with the aid of a few tools, will help to keep you safe and sound. Check out these tips for keeping your property safe while you’re off exploring the world or just getting away from it all.

## Your Security System is your First Line of Defense

Your first and best line of defense against burglars and other criminals is your security system. Make sure that you don’t forget to turn it on before you leave! Also, be sure that you’re taking advantage of all the features available to you, like wireless monitoring via wifi, window sensors, and motion detectors. These are more effective at keeping intruders away than a simple door alarm. You should also have signs displayed around your business advertising that the premises are protected. Burglars often seek the path of least resistance, so if they know you have a security system, they’re less likely to attempt a break in.

## Don’t Advertise your Absence

You also shouldn’t advertise that you’ll be going out of town; if you have to close up shop while you’re gone, a simple “we will be closed on these days” notice on the door will be enough warning for your customers. Perhaps even a white lie, like claiming that you’ll be closed for repairs is preferential; this makes it sound like someone will still be on site throughout the day. If you don’t like the idea of leaving your property alone for several days, or if you want to stay open to avoid losing business, you can have an employee or other trusted person come by and run the place as usual. Just make sure they know the code for the alarm, and check on them to make sure they’ve set it when they leave at the end of the day.

## Put a Stopper on Mail and Package Services

If you have mail delivered to your business rather than to a PO box, call the post office and have them stop delivery for a few days. Mail piled up on a front step or overflowing from a mailbox is a giveaway that no one is around. Don’t make any big orders that will arrive during this time. If you have to, make sure that someone is there to bring them inside. If your mailing service cannot be stopped or held, invest in a mail receptacle that deposits mail inside your business instead. In that case, at least your pile of mail won’t be visible at a quick glance from the street.

While you’re on vacation, it’s advisable to invest in *extra* protection for your business and its assets. Forgetting and stepping away from it all might seem attractive, but, if you remember your security, you’ll thank yourself later when you return to a safe and sound business space.
