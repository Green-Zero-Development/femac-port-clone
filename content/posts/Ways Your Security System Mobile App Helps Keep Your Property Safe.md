If you’ve recently been thinking about a security system upgrade, and doing your research into the new models on the market today, you have probably seen quite a few that work best when interacting with an app on your smartphone. Don’t be dismayed at yet another piece of technology and program you need to learn. These mobile apps are actually very user-friendly and make the system all the more effective. Take a look at just a few of the perks these apps bring:

## #1 24-7 access to your video surveillance system

With these apps, you can watch what’s happening at your front door, or any other place on your property, in real-time. You’ll never have to wonder what is going on at your house again! This is helpful for more than just thefts, of course. Working parents can know exactly when teenagers arrive home, you can know when a package is delivered, whether the neighbor’s dog is in your yard, and much more.

## #2 Alarm alerts for faster security response time

Watching something as it is happening means response time is cut much shorter as well. Yes, your security system will contact the police on its own in the event of a break-in, but the offenders must set off the alarm first. If you can see prowlers before they smash the window, that takes precious minutes off the police’s time getting to your house. They may just find them still in the act!

## #3 Access to automation features such as door locks and lighting control

Again, catching thieves is not the only reason for a security system. How many times have you left the house, and wondered if you forgot to lock the front door behind you? Or left your business and wondered if someone turned off all the lights? A u-turn and trip back to check wastes your time! With your mobile app, you can control features like lights and locks from the palm of your hand.
