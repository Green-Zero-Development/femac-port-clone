You may have heard the phrase “Z- Wave” lately in passing from those in the home and business security industry. If you’re just beginning to learn about home and business automation and how everything can blend together, then Z-Wave is something you should learn more about.

## What is Z-Wave?

Z-Wave is a wireless communication standard used in a majority of the leading automation devices on today’s market. Similar to wi-fi and other wireless communication, this technology allows devices to “talk” to each other and carry out specific functions like adjusting thermostats, turning lights on and off, or locking and unlocking doors, and more. Don’t worry though, Z-Wave uses a different frequency than wi-fi so there isn’t a chance of interference with your other devices.

## How Z-Wave Devices Work in an Automation System

All of your Z-Wave devices must work through a “Hub” or “Control Panel”. You set up a Smartphone, Tablet, or standard computer and send commands to your Z-Wave devices. It is also common for the “Hub” to be a Alarm System Control Panel.

Having your Automation run through an Alarm System control panel means you won’t have to purchase an additional control panel to have a fully functional automation system. This saves time and money,and you have only one system to learn and you can control it from one App remotely!

Z-Wave devices coupled with an alarm system and App means you never have turn around and go back to the office to see if you turned off the lights, locked the door, set the alarm, or turned down the thermostat again!
