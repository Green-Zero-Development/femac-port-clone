Video surveillance camera placement also involves a lot of technical knowledge to avoid all of the common problems that plague improperly installed surveillance systems, such as fuzzy images, glare, and reduced coverage area.</description>

      <description>One of the biggest parts of being a responsible gun owner is implementing safe storage practices. The vast majority of at-home gun accidents take place when a gun has not been properly secured. It doesn’t take fancy gadgets or expensive accessories to keep your family safe– all you need is a bit of common sense, and plenty of communication.
Put the firearm away when you aren’t using it When you aren’t using it, your gun should always be kept in a locked safe or case.</description>

      <description>Many security systems require you to set up a four-digit pin number as your access code. Some systems will generate a pin for you, but most will ask you to pick a number of your own. Picking a good pin number can be more difficult than you might think. On one hand, you want to pick something that you and your family or coworkers can easily remember. But on the other, if it’s a simple or obvious number to you, then it will be easier for someone else to guess.</description>

      <description>From furniture sets to large family heirlooms, your storage building holds those items that you just aren’t quite ready to give up. Since they aren’t in your house, you may not think about these items when you’re thinking about your home security; however, for that same exact reason, the contents of your storage building are more susceptible to theft and tampering than anything inside of your home. It is important that you create a strong security system for your storage building to protect it from burglars and vandals.</description>

However, the mere existence of a security camera provides safety. An alarm system or access control system will help your small business in many ways. To decide if one is right for your company, consider the following:

      <description>When you want to keep something safe, what do you do?
Did you say “lock it up”? While that’s a pretty good answer, a traditional lock and key are not the only products a commercial business can or even should use. There are many downsides of this type of security, and limitations on how it can be used.
Multiple Doors Requires Multiple Keys Every door requires it’s own key. One for the main door, back door, loading dock, your office, filing cabinets, supply closets, product rooms, not to mention what you need for your home and car…it starts to add up quickly.</description>

Fire safety is extremely important, and it should be practiced until it becomes second nature.</description>

Now you can monitor your property when you aren’t on site with smartphone apps that live-stream directly from your on-site cameras. You can also have your system automate the lights inside your business before you arrive, which is really helpful for when you’re coming in for an early morning, or when you want to make it seem as if someone is on site when they really aren’t.</description>
